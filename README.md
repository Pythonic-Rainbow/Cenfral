# Cenfral (Installation guide)

---
### 1. Get Python
Python is the motor of the Cenfral engine. It is IMPOSSIBLE to run Cenfral without Python unless you modified the whole project.  

It is recommended that you download the latest version of [Python 3.x](www.python.org)  
I personally use `Python 3.6.4` to test Cenfral.

Tick the `Add Python to PATH` and `Associate *.py files` boxes unless you know what you are doing.
### 2. Get Cenfral
Cenfral can be downloaded at [Release](https://github.com/Pythonic-Rainbow/Cenfral/releases).  
For most usages, you can simply download `Source code` zip file and extract it to anywhere (If you added Python to PATH)  
### 3. Remove the rust
Run `setup.py`. This will install some files needed for Cenfral and set them up.  

# Now you have successfully setup Cenfral!
